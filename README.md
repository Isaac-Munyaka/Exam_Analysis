Analysis to compare exam perfomance in Zeraki School
The Dean of Zeraki School has a meeting with the school's Board of Management (BOM) in 3 hours and has asked me to help him make sense of the attached data to allow them to have an informed conversation with the BOM. 

## Assumptions
The subject Analysis was done using mean marks as the ranking criteria as mean points would have resulted to ties due to the huge number of students
Form 1-3 exam data were combined and an yearly analysis of three exams was done to get a clearer picture of how the classes were performing on year average
For form 4, the pre-mock exam was used for the analysis as it depicted the expected performance in KCSE
Name does not have any values and Admission number column were removed since they donâ€™t have much relevance in the overall analysis
Grades were initially removed from marks for the assumption that they will interfere with statistical computing of mean marks since they are not numerical
The grades were later added

## Conclusions
The School has trend of recording better performance in Technicals and Humanities  and poor performance in Sciences and Mathematics

Therefore more action is needed to improve the performance of Sciences and Mathematics

## Recommendations

The Board of Management should hire more Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics teachers as they had the worst performance

The Board to consider improving and stocking the science Laboratories as part of ensuring adequate resources to the students

The board to consider adding music resources to ensure form 1 and form 2 students perform better and end up choosing taking Music in form 3 and form 4
